I am Zihao Dong, a PhD Student at Northeastern University (Khoury College of Computer Science) since Sept. 2023 advised by [Prof. Michael Everett](mfe7.github.io).

Research Interest
======

My research focuses on the perception and planning for autonomy in complex (off-road) environments. Specifically, I am interested in efficient LiDAR-based localization that can robustly operate for long horizon missions, and the utilization of learning methods in model-based planning. To provide safety or robustness guarantee, I am working on the integration of uncertainty quantification techniques in these problem settings.

I received the BS in Computer Science from UCLA in 2023 with honor SUMMA CUM LAUDE (Top 5%).
