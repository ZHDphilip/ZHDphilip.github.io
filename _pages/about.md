I am Zihao Dong, a PhD Student at Northeastern University (Khoury College of Computer Science) since Sept. 2023 advised by [Prof. Michael Everett](mfe7.github.io).

Research Interest
======
My research interest lies at the intersection of computer vision, robotics, and verificable machine learning. I am motivated to develop robust, safe, and efficient algorithms for all robotics subdomains, including navigation, collision avoidance, and manipulation, via deep learning approaches, and verify their desired properties using reachability analysis and optimization based methods.

Prior to joining Northeastern, I received a BS in CS (SUMMA CUM LAUDE) from UCLA in 2023, where I had the chance to work with [Prof. Cho-jui Hsieh](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/) on adversarial attack and dataset condensation.
